# Kindmanage

It's a dead simple project management app built with Ruby on Rails. It borrows a lot of philosophies from existing apps such as Twitter, Facebook, Basecamp, Gmail and several others. Kindmanage focuses on communication first and foremost during the lifespan of a project.

## Features

These are still being worked out. However, some features just need explanation.

### Workspaces

Whether you work with a project individually or with a team, managing the varying priorities of project-related data such as notes, task, etc can be difficult and time consuming. Workspaces makes an attempt to fix this.

As a web designer I typically am working on several projects at a time. Every note, task and shared document among those projects have a specific priority while others may not have any at all. With workspaces, I can take a task or note from project **A**, **B** and **X** and stream them to a workspace by way of hashtag.

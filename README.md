# Kindmanage

It's a dead simple project management app built with Ruby on Rails. It borrows a lot of philosophies from existing apps such as Twitter, Facebook, Basecamp, Gmail and several others. Kindmanage focuses on communication first and foremost during the lifespan of a project.

Kindmanage is also the result of another small project known as [My Weekend App](http://twitter.com/myweekendapp). It's really just a story of a designer trying bud into a rails developer. Since I have no real programming experience aside from CSS, HTML and some PHP, the challenge was attractive, so I went for it with Kindmanage.


## Why?

I was a pretty big advocate for 37signal's Basecamp, loved it! But eventually I became overwhelmed with the interface. Not so much the design, but the flow at which I managed and created information. Everything was just far to peppered for me. Kindmanage in a lot of ways is scratching my own itch as I absolutely cannot stand UI bloat.

## Features

In Kindmanage, projects are simply just a collection of information which include notes, tasks, milestones and discussions about those very items. KM doesn't set out to change the kind of information a project manages, but it more or less wants to change the way you deal with it.

Features in KM are still being worked out and until the basics are humming along smoothly, there will be no delineation of specific features for now.

## Can I fork?

You can, but if you know your rails apps, you will likely laugh at my code. Other than that, go for it.
